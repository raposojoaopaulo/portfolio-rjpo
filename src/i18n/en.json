    "description": "I'm a full stack developer focused on Laravel and Ruby on Rails, driven by solving real-world problems through well-structured solutions. My approach is both systemic and practical — I like to understand how things work before building anything. That mindset helps me deliver stable, maintainable code that makes sense from both a technical and business perspective.",
    "description-2": "I believe that software development is an art, and like any art, it should be done with passion and dedication. In every project, I strive to combine technical clarity with a product-oriented vision, understanding the needs of both the client and the end user. I like to think beyond the code — considering the flow, experience, and impact of what I'm building.",
