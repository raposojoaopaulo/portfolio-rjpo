    "description": "I'm João, a full stack developer with a long-standing background in design. It was through shapes, colors, and compositions that I learned to observe, test, build, and rebuild. Over time, I realized that programming isn’t all that different — it also involves choices, rhythm, structure, and intention.",
    "description-2": "I like to understand how things work, break ideas apart and rebuild them with logic. To me, development goes beyond writing code — it's about making choices around flow, structure, and experience. I aim to work on systems that are clear, useful, and well-organized, both inside and out.",
    "description-3": "Today I work with technologies like Laravel and Ruby on Rails, but more than the stack itself, I care about the solution as a whole. It's not always the fastest path, but it's almost always the most solid one.",
